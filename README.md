# VITA SOMNIORUM

I created this website as a project for my CS50 certification, the homepage problem set to be precise

The website is a simple design agency website that showcases their services, works, a blog and also an about section

Derived inspiration from [**10Clouds**](https://10clouds.com/) website. Special thanks to [**TheDesignMerlin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/psalmuhel/) for his advice and input

The images used in this project where gotten from a variety of sites including but not limited to:

- [**Freepik**](freepik.com)

- [**Unsplash**](unsplash.com)
